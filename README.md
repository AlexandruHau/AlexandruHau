### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at the University of Edinburgh in 4th year, at the School of Physics and Astronomy. I have always been passionate about mathematics and life sciences, as they contain key answers about the way our world works. Due to my curious nature, I have always been eager to discover such secrets. 

During my University years, I have become more and more aware of how the computer can help humanity in understanding various features and behaviours in our world - from financial modeling and business, to Molecular Dynamics and particle collisions. Consequently, my interest in Data Science, Monte Carlo Simulations, Machine Learning, Numerical Algorithms and Quantum Computing has greatly increased.
